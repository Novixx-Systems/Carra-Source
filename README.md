# Carra
Carra is a Top-Down GTA clone written in WinForms. It is not meant to be a serious game, but rather a fun project.

Note that unlike most of my other projects, this one is not open source. I am not sure if I will ever release the source code under an open source license, but I probably won't.


## Features

* Top-Down GTA-style gameplay

* 2D graphics

* Music (PLEASE CREATE AN ISSUE IF YOU THINK THERE'S A COPYRIGHT ISSUE)
