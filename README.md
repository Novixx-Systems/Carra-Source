# Carra
Carra is a Top-Down GTA clone written in WinForms. It is not meant to be a serious game, but rather a fun project.

Note that unlike most of my other projects, this one is not open source. I am not sure if I will ever release the source code under an open source license, but I probably won't.


## Features

* Top-Down GTA-style gameplay

* 2D graphics

* Music (PLEASE CREATE AN ISSUE IF YOU THINK THERE'S A COPYRIGHT ISSUE)


To avoid more copyright issues, I will not be including any music in the repository, so the code will compile, but will throw errors when enabled the radio, If you want to play the game, download it from the website.
